# Sending Text Message
This is a web app which i created in python using the nexmo api with the help of which you can send text messages to the specified numbers automatically each time this api is triggered.<br>
We can also get information about the message being delivered or not.<br>

Earlier this used to be called as nexmo but now it has been rebranded to Vonage.

I have used it as  part of my project where it was sending me a text message whenever a animal is seen on a camera. I have also used it in another project where i was getting a message as my site was down and as soon as i get the message i can fix that up.
<br>You can either use it in backend without code or can trigger the api with some input taken from frontend.I have used it in the former way.
